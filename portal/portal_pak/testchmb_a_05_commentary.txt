		"synopsis" "For the first few months of development, we rendered the views through portals to two offscreen textures. This approach was easy to implement and was compatible with a wide range of graphics hardware.  Unfortunately, this method was incompatible with antialiasing and consumed a large amount of video memory in order to handle recursive views through several portals.  Because of these disadvantages, we switched to a system which renders portal views recursively into the frame buffer with the aid of the stencil buffer to isolate pixels corresponding to a given portal. This is a more effective scheme because it is compatible with antialiasing and does not consume any additional video memory for offscreen textures."

		"synopsis" "Because our test chamber environments were simplified for training purposes, we created visual hot spots within the rooms to guide players' attention. The design is essentially a balance between round objects and sharp objects, the sharp objects representing background elements and the round objects - such as doors and moveable props - comprising our points of visual interest."
